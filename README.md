This Python script uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection via a webcam, leveraging OpenCV for image processing and cvzone for enhanced visualization. It captures video frames, detects objects, draws bounding boxes with labels, and displays confidence scores. The script continuously processes frames, identifying objects like people, cars, and animals, and overlays detection results onto the video feed.
